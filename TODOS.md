#Things that need to get done

* Oxygen font switched out for Roboto Slab Light
  * if slab is too thin, do regular weight
* jQuery plugin for the images to be the right width
* Elevator.js for 'back to top' [Elevator.js](http://tholman.com/elevator.js/)
* move the transition for the social icons to default sass variables

#After the site is due

* Convert the jQuery plugin to a javascript library that no longer requires a jQuery plugin
  * IE9 Support is a maybe... so IE10+

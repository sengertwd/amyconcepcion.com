      <p>The task for this project was to design expressive packaging based on a food dish that we have a personal connection with, such as a dish that our mother always used to cook, and choose three of its spices to package together. Arroz con Gandules (Rice with Pigeon Peas) is something Puerto Rican families always have at get-togethers. Three main spices for this dish are: Adobo, Saz√≥n, and Basil.</p>
      <p>The overall package design portrays the friendly, communal aspects of this dish and its culture. Stylized utensil icons match the curves of the logo, and people icons create the feeling of a get-together. The design is very inviting and its playfulness would catch the attention of people walking by and looking on shelves.</p>

      <p>WESTBOUND developed from the notion that the Wild West was a free, rugged, untouched stretch of desert. The idea was to combine all of the traditional attributes of the Wild West (cowboys, horses, sheriffs) with modern design to create a rough masculine brand with a contemporary feel.</p>

      <p>TCulture is a very important part of most peoplesâ€™ lives, and each culture has traditions around food. Often a specific dish is important for different occasions. It can be interesting to learn about or try dishes from another culture, but it is also important to have respect for the culture and what that dish means to it. The Spicery aims to bring these special dishes to those interested in the tastes of another culture, but need a little help getting started. By providing starter packs of three main spices, a shopping list for additional ingredients, cooking instructions, and individual jars of spices also available for purchase, The Spicery gives customers the basics needed to get cooking.</p><p>

      <h1>Logo</h1>
      <p>The logo needed to be friendly and also elegant, as this is a dish used for get-togethers and big events. After experimenting with sketching with paint and Sharpie, this curvy bold hand-done custom logo was chosen.</p>

        <p>Icons of utensils and people were developed. They are used on/inside the package and on the jar labels. Not only do they portray the fact that this is a communal dish, but they are also eye-catching and fun.</p>

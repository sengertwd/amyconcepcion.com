      <p>Day-Trip is a small web application that allows you to choose a location or use your current location to find activities and things to do around you. Once you’ve found something interesting, you can drag the activity to your timeline and create a plan for the whole day. Once you’ve finalized your timeline, you’ll be able to share with your friends thru a unique link that’ll let them view a copy of your timeline.</p>
      <p>Day-Trip puts a focus on trying something new that you might otherwise not be exposed to. There are countless places and activities to do in nearly every city that don’t get enough love. Day-Trip seeks to bring out the adventurer in everyone whether your medium is outdoors activities or trying a new restaurant or visiting a local landmark. Day-Trip wants to help you find what you’re doing this weekend.</p>

      <p>WESTBOUND developed from the notion that the Wild West was a free, rugged, untouched stretch of desert. The idea was to combine all of the traditional attributes of the Wild West (cowboys, horses, sheriffs) with modern design to create a rough masculine brand with a contemporary feel.</p>
